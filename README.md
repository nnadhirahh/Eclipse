<h2>Concept Proposal</h2>

<h3>1.0 Problem Space</h3>

Food waste is the largest component of household waste with Australians throwing out 1 in 5 shopping bags worth of groceries every year (SIK, 2011). If food waste were a country, itâ€™s emissions would be third in the world, behind that of the U.S. and China (National Geographic, 2015). In Australia alone, the food waste produced is a mind-boggling five million tonnes every year (Department of the Environment and Energy, 2016) and from that amount, 10 percent of it is from food that restaurants buy (Barclay, 2012). One of the reasons why restaurants contribute to that amount of food waste is mostly due to most restaurant owners treating food waste as something of a low priority and they would rather prioritize the quality of the food more (Barclay, 2012). Moreover, it is also due to the lack of understanding the restaurant owners have in regards to the food waste situation (Barclay, 2012). 

There are a lot of things that could be done to reduce food waste. Some could be as simple as just having a good plan. Reducing food waste will not just help the environment generally, it also helps to save some money, energy and labour wasted to produce the food specifically. 

Our team focus is to examine past solutions undertaken to reduce food waste, both at home and in a restaurant environment. Using technology, we can then help restaurants grasp the current food waste problem and the importance of managing food waste. Although it would take some time and effort to break the habit, Chris Moyer of the National Restaurant Association proved that it is possible (Barclay, 2012).
